# CircleOfFifths
Animated circle of fifths that plays and animates each key 

example: [Circle of Fifths](https://www.guitarland.com/MusicTheoryWithToneJS/CircleOfFifths/index.html)

This uses four js libraries
- Tone.js (for sound)
- greensock.js (for value interpolations)
- winwheel.js  (for circle specific items)
- musicNotationCanvas.js (for notation and animation of scale)

When the circle of fifths is changed to a new location (via the incremental buttons or the spin the wheel button) the new scale will play a one octave major scale.  Also the key signature is shown.
