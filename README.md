# CircleOfFifths
Animated circle of fifths that plays each key 

example: [Circle of Fifths](https://www.guitarland.com/MusicTheoryWithToneJS/CircleOfFifths/index.html)

This uses four js libraries
- Tone.js (for sound)
- greensock.js (for value interpolations)
- winwheel.js  (for circle specific items)
- musicNotationCanvas.js (for notation of scale)

When the circle of fifths is changed to a new location (via the incremental buttons or the spin the wheel button) the new scale will play from low tonic up an octave and back down.  Also the key signature is shown.
