# CircleOfFifths
Animated circle of fifths that plays each key 

This uses three js libraries
- Tone.js (for sound)
- greensock.js (for value interpolations)
- winwheel.js  (for circle specific items)

When the circle of fifths is changed to a new location (via the incremental buttons or the spin the wheel button) the new scale will play from low tonic up and octave and back down.  Also the key signature is shown.
